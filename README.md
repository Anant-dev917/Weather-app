# Weather-app
A python Tkinter application that displays the current weather of any location on earth, alongwith it's weather forecast 

All the weather data are fetched from OpenWeather's weather API. You'll need to sign in to get your API key. The latitude/longitude of different locations are obtained from python's geopy. 

You'll need to resize the label and image sizes in the Tkinter GUI according to your screen resolution, also adjust their coordinates accordingly. The existing coordinates and sizes for different Tkinter objects in the uploaded files are specific to my screen size. 


I made this project for as part of my journey in learning python. Appreciate any feedbacks.
